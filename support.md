# Get support

Hub engineers can provide support and debugging for issues that are related to the 2i2c JupyterHub infrastructure.

Send all support requests as an email to [**`support@2i2c.org`**](mailto:support@2i2c.org).
This is email will be routed to the 2i2c support team, and we will get back to you shortly!

When you make a support request, please include as much information as possible in order to provide context needed to resolve your issue!

## Who can ask for support?

A **Community Representative** of a hub should be the one that surfaces support requests to the 2i2c Engineering Team.
Before reaching out to 2i2c for support, this person should work with others in their community to understand the problem and to ensure that it is something that requires intervention from a 2i2c Engineer.

## What kinds of things require support?

2i2c Engineers are needed to support major infrastructure problems or enhancements.
They are not needed for doing things like regular administrative tasks on a JupyterHub (see the other sections in this guide for how a Hub Administrator can accomplish these tasks instead).
