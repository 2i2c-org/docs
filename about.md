# About this Project

The 2i2c Hubs for All pilot is an attempt at making interactive computing environments more accessible to the research and education community, with a focus on smaller colleges and minority-serving institutions. It is a collaboration between the following three organizations.

## What are the technical goals of the Hubs for All pilot?

We have the following goals in conducting this pilot:

- Build technical infrastructure that can automatically and flexibly deploy lightweight JupyterHubs
- Understand the limitations of this approach, both technical and user-oriented
- Improve the underlying technology needed in order to accomplish this
- Build relationships with partners in research and education who wish to use these hubs for their use-cases
- Develop a model for sustainably deploying and maintaining these hubs for research and education

## What is the main product for this pilot?

The 2i2c Hubs for All pilot is a collection of [JupyterHubs](https://jupyter.org/hub) running customized environments for research and education in the cloud. Each hub is deployed for an institution or group of people. We wish for each hub to be customizable and tailored for the community that uses it.

If you'd like to learn more about the infrastructure that makes up a single 2i2c Hub, see [](infrastructure.md).

## Who is paying for this infrastructure?

Cloud computing credits for a subset of 2i2c Hubs are provided by [CloudBank](https://www.cloudbank.org/) as part of a collaboration with UC Berkeley. Other 2i2c Hubs are paid for by 2i2c.

## Who is running this infrastructure?

The cloud technology behind the 2i2c Hubs for All project is designed and developed by 2i2c, and maintained and supported by 2i2c and CloudBank. The UC Berkeley Data Science Education Program is providing pedagogical training and support for users of 2i2c Hubs.

## Will this infrastructure be free forever?

Probably not. 2i2c is running this pilot in order to better-understand the needs of the research and education community, and to arrive at a sustainable model for providing these services in a sustainable manner in the future. We plan to offer 2i2c Hubs in the future at a price that is sustainable for both research and educational communities, as well as 2i2c.

## What happens if I want to move off of a 2i2c hub?

2i2c Hubs are designed to use entirely open source tools that are vendor- and workflow-agnostic. Our goal is to provide you with interactive computing environments that seamlessly integrate with pre-existing workflows across the research and education community. That means that it should be **extremely easy** to move off of a 2i2c Hub and into a different online environment that uses the Jupyter stack (or simply onto your own computer).
