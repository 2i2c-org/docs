# Ending your service

If you'd like 2i2c to stop managing a JupyterHub for your community, here are a few steps to follow.

## Read the migration guide

There are a few things you might want to do as a part of either migrating off of your current hub, or taking control of it yourselves.
Our [migration guide](howto:migrate) covers several common topics that are relevant to migrating off of a 2i2c hub.

## Send us an email

Send an email to `partnerships@2i2c.org` requesting that we terminate the 2i2c hub service for your community.
We will end the service at the end of the month, send you a final invoice, and then coordinate with you to decommission your hub.
