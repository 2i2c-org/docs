Project Jupyter  
    A community-supported project that builds a variety of tools for interactive computing - from user interfaces, to document formats, to cloud infrastructure. Project Jupyter is one of the most-impactful open source projects in data science in the last ten years, and was awarded the [ACM Software System award](https://blog.jupyter.org/jupyter-receives-the-acm-software-system-award-d433b0dfe3a2) for its impact.

JupyterHub
    [JupyterHub](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/) is an open-source project for providing and managing interactive computing sessions to multiple users, usually deployed on shared infrastructure.

JupyterHub for Kubernetes
    [JupyterHub for Kubernetes](http://z2jh.jupyter.org) is a distribution of JupyterHub designed for use with the scalable Kubernetes platform. Kubernetes is cloud- and infrastructure-agnostic, and is flexible enough to scale to large numbers of users and complex computational needs.

Jupyter Interfaces
Jupyter Notebooks and JupyterLab
    [Jupyter Notebooks / Lab](http://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/) are open-source user interfaces for doing interactive data analysis. Notebooks provide an opinionated, linear, document-like workflow, while Lab provides a more flexible and composable interface.

Right to Replicate
    The [Right to Replicate](https://2i2c.org/right-to-replicate/) is a guiding principle of 2i2c Hub infrastructure. It gives communities the right to replicate their infrastructure in its  entirety elsewhere, with or without 2i2c. It entails running infrastructure that is open-source and vendor-agnostic, and in an open and transparent manner. See the [Right to Replicate](https://2i2c.org/right-to-replicate/) document for more details.

Hub Community
    The community of practice that a Managed JupyterHub serves. This includes leadership of the community as well as users of the hub. The Hub Community is usually organized around a particular use-case or dataset, and may or may not be affiliated with the same organization.
