# Pricing and costs

2i2c performs a number of services around developing and operating open cloud infrastructure as well as guiding communities in using this infrastructure for research and education.
We sustain and grow 2i2c by charging fees in exchange for these services.
This allows us to effectively pool resources across organizations in order to run shared infrastructure that many benefit from.
