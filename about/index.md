# Managed Hub Service

The Managed JupyterHubs Service is an open, scalable, sustainable cloud service for interactive computing environments in research and education.
It follows a "DevOps as a Service" model where communities in research and education can pay for managed cloud infrastructure that runs on an entirely open source stack, and give you [the right to replicate your infrastructure](https://2i2c.org/right-to-replicate).

It is run by [2i2c](https://2i2c.org), a non-profit organization that develops and operates interactive computing infrastructure for research and education.
2i2c values transparency and community driven infrastructure.
The sections below describe the Managed JupyterHub Service, its strategy and goals, as well as information about its major features and pricing.
