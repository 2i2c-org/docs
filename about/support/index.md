# User and community support

As a part of the {term}`Managed JupyterHub Service`, we define two different kinds of user-support.
Documentation about each can be found at the links below.

- **Change requests and incidents** are discussions around making changes to infrastructure in order to improve the hub service for users or to resolve outages.
  See {ref}`2i2c's Support and Incident documentation <tc:support:guide>` for more information.
- **Usecase guidance** involves assisting users to help them be more affective in using the service infrastructure to accomplish their goals.
  The **Hub Administration Topics** and **User Guide** in this documentation serve this purpose.

  :::{note}
  We are actively exploring how to provide more guidance and support to the communities that use our infrastructure, see [this blog post](https://2i2c.org/blog/2022/job-product-community-lead/) for more information.
