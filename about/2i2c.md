# About 2i2c

[2i2c](http://2i2c.org) (the International Interactive Computing Collaboration) makes interactive computing more accessible and powerful for research and education. It does so by developing, designing, and managing open source interactive computing infrastructure, and by contributing to open source communities that underlie and create this infrastructure.

:::

2i2c's engineering team is comprised of [a team of open source infrastructure engineers](http://2i2c.org/about/) with extensive experience working with open source, community-driven projects (particularly in the Jupyter ecosystem). Its strategy is defined by a [steering council](https://2i2c.org/founders/) made of up leaders at the intersection of the Jupyter Project and use-cases in research and education. This group has more than 15 collective years of experience running large-scale cloud infrastructure for interactive computing in university and research contexts. 2i2câ€™s team are co-leaders and major contributors in many projects in this space, with these notable highlights:

- [The Pangeo project](https://pangeo.io/) - A community platform for Big Data geoscience connecting researchers across the world to large-scale computing and data infrastructure.
- [The UC Berkeley DataHubs](https://docs.datahub.berkeley.edu/en/latest/) - A collection of university-wide JupyterHubs for education serving many thousands of students.
- [The Binder Project](https://docs.mybinder.org/) - a large public cloud service for reproducible computing environments using JupyterHub, serving nearly 150,000 sessions each week.
- [The Syzygy Project](https://syzygy.ca/) - A network of federated JupyterHubs for more than 15 Canadian Universities running on national infrastructure.
