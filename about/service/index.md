# Our collaborative service model

Here we provide a high-level overview of our Managed JupyterHub Service and the major teams, processes, and expectations for both 2i2c and the partner communities we work with.

## Our shared responsibility model

Our hub service is a collaboration between 2i2c and one or more communities.
We break down the responsibilities that must be carried out in order to successfully run a service.
We can then assign or share these responsibilities with partner communities according to their needs and interests.

## Your Right to Replicate your infrastructure

A core principle of 2i2c is to build and manage technology that is controlled by the community that uses it.
One way in which we adhere to this principle is by respecting the [Community Right to Replicate](https://2i2c.org/right-to-replicate/). This states the following:

```{epigraph}
The Right to Replicate gives communities the right to replicate their infrastructure in its entirety elsewhere, with or without 2i2c.
```

Following this principle leads to a more equitable and more productive ecosystem for research and education in the cloud, and helps avoid many of the potential downsides of relying on a cloud vendor for infrastructure.
Read the [Right to Replicate](https://2i2c.org/right-to-replicate/) documentation for more information about what this means.

## Service Level Objectives

Our Service Level Objectives define our **goals in running the service** for each partner community.
This includes goals like service uptime and support responsiveness.

## Cost model

There are two types of costs associated with our service.
We treat each of these separately in order to be transparent about where community costs are coming from.
They will be covered as either two separate invoices, or two different line items on the same invoice.

**Staff costs** cover all of the human time that goes into managing, supporting, developing, and improving our hub service.
See [](service-offerings) for details, and {external:tc:ref}`the Cost Model section in our Team Compass <costs:human>` for our staffing cost model.

**Cloud costs** cover the cost we pay a cloud provider for the infrastructure that powers your service.
This is either on a dedicated cloud cluster, or on cluster that you share with other communities.
  See [](costs:cloud) for a guide on how to estimate your community's cloud costs.
