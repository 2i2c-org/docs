# Usecases and prices

Our Hub Service is an open, scalable, sustainable cloud service for interactive computing environments.
We offer cloud infrastructure hubs that are designed for use-cases in research and education, and flexible enough to be tailored to the needs of each community.

They run entirely on community-driven and open-source infrastructure,
follow a [community-centric collaborative service model](./index.md), and give you [the right to replicate your infrastructure](https://2i2c.org/right-to-replicate).

A table summarizing our services and their prices are at the link below.
The rest of the pages in this section describe the cloud services that we offer and the use-cases they are designed for.
See [](./index.md) for more about our collaborative service model.

## Research use-cases

JupyterHub is an excellent gateway to cloud-based resources and data analytics environments.
It can be used as a part of distributed scientific collaborations, scientific communities with cloud-based worklfows, and scalable analytics environments for research teams.
