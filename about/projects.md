# Communities using the 2i2c Hubs

This page has information about the communities that are currently using the 2i2c Hubs, as well as some domain-focused projects.

## Pilot Hub Projects

2i2c is running a few focused pilots to explore hub infrastructure for specific use-cases, sometimes in partnership with other communities. Below is a short description of each.

### Hubs for Education pilot

The Hubs for Education pilot is an attempt at making interactive computing environments more accessible to the research and education community, with a focus on smaller colleges and minority-serving institutions. It is a collaboration between [CloudBank](https://www.cloudbank.org/), the [Berkeley Division of Computing, Data Science, and Society](https://data.berkeley.edu/dsep), and [2i2c](https://2i2c.org).

Cloud computing credits for these hubs are provided by [CloudBank](https://www.cloudbank.org/) as part of a collaboration with UC Berkeley.

In addition, hubs that are not covered by CloudBank credits are paid for by a grant from [the JROST Rapid Response Fund](https://investinopen.org/blog/jrost-rapid-response-fund-awardees/).


### Pangeo Hubs pilot

The Pangeo Hubs pilot is a collaboration with [the Pangeo Project](https://pangeo.io/), which is a distributed scientific community for big-data geoscience.
The Pangeo approach has become a leading approach in cloud-native geospatial analytics, and drives development across many parts of the PyData ecosystem.
This pilot is an attempt at deploying Pangeo-like hubs with scalable Dask clusters via Kubernetes.
