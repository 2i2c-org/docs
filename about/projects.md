## Hubs for Education pilot

The 2i2c Hubs for All pilot is an attempt at making interactive computing environments more accessible to the research and education community, with a focus on smaller colleges and minority-serving institutions. It is a collaboration between [CloudBank](https://www.cloudbank.org/), the [Berkeley 
Computing, Data Science, and Society](https://data.berkeley.edu/dsep), and [2i2c](https://2i2c.org).

Cloud computing credits for these hubs are provided by [CloudBank](https://www.cloudbank.org/) as part of a collaboration with UC Berkeley.


## A list of current hubs

Below is a relatively up-to-date list of the hubs we are currently deploying as part of this pilot.
