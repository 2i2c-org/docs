The 2i2c Educational Hubs provide standard data science environments and infrastructure that is meant for teaching data science. They are inspired by 2i2c's experience with the [DataHubs at UC Berkeley](https://docs.datahub.berkeley.edu/en/latest/).

## Inspiration for our educational hubs

## What does a typical workflow look like?

## What open source tools are featured?

## Communities that use this hub

The Education Hubs come pre-configured with several interfaces and extensions pre-installed to help students learn on the hub.
For example, [`nbgitpuller`](https://jupyterhub.github.io/nbgitpuller/index.html) allows instructors to create "interactive links" that let students quickly grab a copy of a file (e.g., a notebook) and use it in their own Jupyter session.
These can be used in conjunction with tools like [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org) to build connections between your course's content and your online learning environment.

You can find the JupyterHub configuration for 2i2c Education Hubs [at this repository](https://github.com/2i2c-org/pilot-hubs/tree/master/hub-templates/basehub).

### Hubs for All educational pilot

The Hubs for Education pilot is an attempt at making interactive computing environments more accessible to the research and education community, with a focus on smaller colleges and minority-serving institutions. 

Cloud computing credits for these hubs are provided by [CloudBank](https://www.cloudbank.org/) as part of a collaboration with UC Berkeley.

In addition, hubs that are not covered by CloudBank credits are paid for by a grant from [the JROST Rapid Response Fund](https://investinopen.org/blog/jrost-rapid-response-fund-awardees/).
