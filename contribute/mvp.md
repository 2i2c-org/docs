# Minimal viable documentation

Documentation must exist here for a feature to be considered complete. Features aren't finished until they're documented in a way that users can discover and understand them.

We use a simple structure that prioritizes **actionable information first**, followed by technical details for those who need them.

## Documentation template

```markdown
(a-myst-label)=
# A short, discoverable page title

A few sentences answering: What does this allow you to do? Why is it useful? When should you use it? Who is it for?

## How it works

A few sentences describing how to use it, and what it looks like when it works. What should you expect to happen as a user?

## Where to learn more

(optional) Links to upstream documentation or product-specific documentation where users can go into more detail.

## Who can access it?

(optional) If this is only available to subsets of communities or users, state which users/tiers/etc can use it.
```

## Key principles

- **Answer value questions first**: What, why, when, who - help readers decide if this applies to them
- **Show how to use it**: Actionable steps and what to expect
- **Technical details are optional**: Add deeper resources only if needed
- **Keep it brief**: A few sentences per section is often enough
