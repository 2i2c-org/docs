# Style guide

A few principles to follow when writing documentation:

- **Short**. Keep the content easy to skim and quickly learn. Use content words in section headers and page titles for easier reading.
- **Actionable**. Don't be too verbose. Assume readers don't have much patience digging through docs.
- **Modular**. Write content that is self-contained and tight in scope. Have more, smaller pages under high-level topics.
- **Interconnected**. Heavily cross-reference other pages in our docs and in external docs. Help readers discover other related topics and content.
