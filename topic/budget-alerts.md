# Budget Forecast Alerts

## What are budget forecast alerts?

Budget forecast alerts allow 2i2c to be notified when the cloud costs of a given project are likely to exceed a given threshold for a given month.
These are _early warning_ notifications designed to prevent run-away cloud bills by giving us time to act to reduce costs.
2i2c staff receive budget forecast alerts at the `support@2i2c.org` mailbox.

## When will _you_ receive a budget forecast alert?

2i2c will forward these budget forecast alerts to you, the Community Representative, where 2i2c directly pass through cloud costs.

## What thresholds are used for budget forecast alerts?

We currently set the budget alert threshold to be the average of the past 3 months of expenditure, plus a 20% buffer.
