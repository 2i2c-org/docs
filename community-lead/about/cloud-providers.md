# Cloud providers

2i2c can deploy community hubs on several cloud platforms, giving communities flexibility in where their infrastructure runs.
Note that some [membership tiers](https://2i2c.org/join) may not allow us to deploy your community's hub wherever you want, depending on the complexity of your needs.

## Commercial cloud providers

We support several major international commercial cloud providers and can deploy a hub into most datacenters (or "regions") for each.

### Amazon Web Services (AWS)

[Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) is one of the largest and most widely-used cloud platforms globally, offering extensive infrastructure in regions worldwide.

### Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

[Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) provides robust cloud infrastructure with strong integration with Google's ecosystem and data science tools.

### Microsoft Azure

[Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) is Microsoft's cloud platform with broad enterprise adoption.

:::{note}
Azure deployments may incur an additional cost due to the extra complexity of deploying and managing hubs on this platform.

## Public and governmental cloud providers

These cloud providers are managed by federal teams and resources. Access to them may be dependent on the community or specific grants or awards.

### JetStream2

[JetStream2](https://jetstream-cloud.org/) adds cloud-based, on-demand computing and data analysis resources to the national cyberinfrastructure. It is managed by the [Pervasive Technology Institute at Indiana University](https://pti.iu.edu/).

To see if your community is eligible for a JetStream2 hub, see [the JetStream2 getting started guide](https://docs.jetstream-cloud.org/general/gettingstarted/).

## How to choose a cloud provider

The choice of cloud provider depends on several factors:

- **Data location requirements**: Some communities need data to remain in specific geographic regions for compliance or performance reasons.
- **Existing infrastructure**: Communities may want to deploy on the same provider where they already have data or resources.
- **Cost and funding**: Different providers have different pricing models, and some communities may have credits or grants for specific providers.
- **Access and eligibility**: Public cloud providers like JetStream2 may have specific eligibility requirements.

If you're unsure which provider is right for your community, contact 2i2c support to discuss your needs.
