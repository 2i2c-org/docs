# Service renewals

2i2c service agreements are typically renewed on an annual basis. This page covers what to expect during the renewal process.

:::{admonition} ⚠️ Work in progress
We are still working out the process for renewals as part of our [new membership model](https://2i2c.org/join). Bear with us as we work out the details!
:::

## Renewal timeline

2i2c will contact you in the months leading up to your membership's end-date. This gives both parties time to:

- Review the current service and any adjustments needed
- Discuss budget and pricing for the next period
- Plan for any changes to infrastructure or service level
- Decide whether to continue, expand, or to end your membership
- Complete administrative and contracting processes

## Prepare for your renewal conversation

Here are a few resources to review as you think about renewals:

- **{doc}`../../admin/monitoring/grafana-dashboards`**: See your hub's usage dashboards to understand activity
- **{doc}`../../admin/monitoring/cost-general`**: Review your hub's cost trends and usage patterns
- **{doc}`../billing/overview`**: Understand how cloud costs work and what drives spending

## If you'd like to end service

If you're considering not renewing, you have a few options:

- **{doc}`ending-service`**: Guidance on exporting your data and transitioning away from 2i2c
- **{doc}`../../admin/service-lifecycle/offboarding`**: Learn how to replicate your own JupyterHub independently using 2i2c's open infrastructure (part of our [Right to Replicate](https://2i2c.org/right-to-replicate))

[Contact 2i2c support](../../support.md) to discuss your timeline and transition plan.
