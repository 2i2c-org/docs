# Ending your 2i2c service

## Exporting your data

Before service ends, ensure all data is exported:

- **Hub replication**: See {doc}`../../admin/service-lifecycle/offboarding` for guidance on replicating your infrastructure independently (part of 2i2c's [Right to Replicate](https://2i2c.org/right-to-replicate))

## Next steps
