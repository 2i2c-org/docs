# Community Hub Guide

This is the community and user documentation for 2i2c's Managed JupyterHub Service.
It is divided into a number of **roles and personas** with relevant topics for each.

See [2i2c's platform description](https://2i2c.org/platform) for an overview of the service.

## Hub user guide

For end-users that use a community hub. These are typically most individuals in our member communities - researchers, post-docs, students, etc.
