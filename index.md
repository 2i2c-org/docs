# The 2i2c Managed JupyterHubs Service

A 2i2c Managed JupyterHub is a cloud-based interactive computing environment built entirely on open-source technology and customized for research and education.
It follows best-practices as recommended from open source communities, and is deployed in a manner that is easy for others to replicate on their own.

Each 2i2c JupyterHub is deployed for a specific community, and can be customized for that community.
It brings together **environments, datasets, computing resources, and content**.

:::{note}
The service is currently in an **alpha phase**, and may evolve as we learn more about how to best serve our target communities.
