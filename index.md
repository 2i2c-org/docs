## Our Infrastructure Guide

The 2i2c Team DevOps guide is what we use to document how to develop and operate the cloud infrastructure that is run by 2i2c.
It contains all the details about how our infrastructure is deployed, how we make changes to it, and team processes around ensuring site reliability.

## Our Team Compass

Transparency and collaboration is at the heart of 2i2c's mission.
We host a public "Team Compass" that provides all of the organization-level policies, practices, and strategy for our team and community.
If you'd like to answer any question about 2i2c as an organization, this is the place to look.
