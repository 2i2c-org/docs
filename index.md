# Community Hub Guide

This is the community and user documentation for 2i2c's Managed JupyterHub Service.
It is divided into a number of **roles and personas** with relevant topics for each.

This documentation is structured into sections that are meant for various **roles and personas**.
We describe each below.

## Hub users

For end-users that use a community hub. These are typically most individuals in our member communities - researchers, post-docs, students, etc.
