# The 2i2c Managed JupyterHubs Pilot

A 2i2c Managed JupyterHub is a cloud-based interactive computing environment built entirely on open-source technology and customized for research and education.
It follows best-practices as recommended from open source communities, and is deployed in a manner that is easy for others to replicate on their own.
Each 2i2c JupyterHub is deployed for a specific community, and can be customized for that community.
It brings together **environments, datasets, computing resources, and content**.

To learn more about 2i2c Managed JupyterHubs, see [](about-the-project).

This guide is for **hub administrators and community representatives** of 2i2c JupyterHubs, or for those who are interested in learning more about the 2i2c JupyterHubs.
