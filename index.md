# Service Guide

This is the primary documentation for 2i2c's Managed JupyterHub Service.
It is the primary source of information about the service, though some service documentation can be found on other sites.

Check out the links above in order to navigate across various 2i2c documentation resources, and see the links below for some explanations and pointers.

## Service documentation locations

Documentation about this service is split in three primary locations:

- [`docs.2i2c.org`](https://docs.2i2c.org): An overview of the Managed JupyterHub Service, as well as documentation that is relevant to {term}`Service Team` members that are outside of 2i2c (such as JupyterHub Administration, User Guides, Pricing, etc). This is most service documentation.
- [`team-compass.2i2c.org/managed-hubs/index`](https://team-compass.2i2c.org/en/latest/projects/managed-hubs/index.html): Documentation about {term}`Service Team` processes that are primarily relevant to 2i2c team members. We put this documentation here to prevent [`docs.2i2c.org`](https://docs.2i2c.org) from getting too cluttered.
- [`infrastructure.2i2c.org`](https://infrastructure.2i2c.org): Our {term}`Cloud Engineering Team` and cloud infrastructure documentation.
