# The 2i2c Hubs Pilot

A 2i2c Hub is a cloud-based interactive computing environment built entirely on open-source technology and customized for research and education.
Each 2i2c Hub is deployed for a specific community, and can be customized for that community.
It brings together **environments, datasets, computing resources, and content**.

This guide is for **administrators and community champions** of 2i2c Hubs, or for those who are interested in learning more about the 2i2c Hubs.

See the sections below (or to the left) for more information.
