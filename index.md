# The 2i2c Hubs Pilot

A 2i2c Hub is a cloud-based interactive computing environment built entirely on open-source technology and customized for research and education.
It follows best-practices as recommended from open source communities, and is deployed in a manner that is easy for others to replicate on their own.
Each 2i2c Hub is deployed for a specific community, and can be customized for that community.
It brings together **environments, datasets, computing resources, and content**.

To learn more about 2i2c Hubs, see [](about-the-project).

This guide is for **administrators and community champions** of 2i2c Hubs, or for those who are interested in learning more about the 2i2c Hubs.

See the sections below (or to the left) for more information.

## Hub configuration reference

These pages list the different ways hub admins can configure how
their hub behaves. Some of these can be changed directly by the hub administrator
via the [configurator](admin/howto/configurator.md) interface, while some of
them require help from a 2i2c engineer.

## Hub administrator how-to guides

These guides have information on how hub admins can perform specific
tasks on their hubs, mostly without requiring any interaction with
2i2c engineers.
