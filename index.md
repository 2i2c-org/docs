# Service Guide

This is the community and user documentation for 2i2c's Managed JupyterHub Service.
It is divided into a number of **roles and personas** with relevant topics for each.

:::{seealso}
Here are a few other locations with relevant information about 2i2c's services.

- [`team-compass.2i2c.org/managed-hubs/index`](https://team-compass.2i2c.org/en/latest/projects/managed-hubs/index.html): Documentation about {team}`Service Team` processes that are primarily relevant to 2i2c team members. We put this documentation here to prevent [`docs.2i2c.org`](https://docs.2i2c.org) from getting too cluttered.
- [`infrastructure.2i2c.org`](https://infrastructure.2i2c.org): Our {team}`Cloud Engineering Team` and cloud infrastructure documentation.
