# The 2i2c Hubs Pilot

The 2i2c Hubs Pilot is a project to provide JupyterHubs running on cloud infrastructure that is both accessible and scalable to many hubs and organizations. Fore more information, see [](about-the-project).

:::{admonition,warning} The pilot is in an alpha phase!
Information that you see here might be out-of-date as our technology stack and information around it are rapidly changing.

## What is a 2i2c Hub?

A 2i2c Hub is a cloud-based interactive computing environment built entirely on open-source technology and customized for research and education. Each 2i2c Hub is deployed for a specific community, and can be customized for that community.
It brings together **environments, datasets, computing resources, and content**. Here's a small overview that gives and idea for the major parts of a 2i2c Hub:

## What environment do I get?

2i2c Hubs have a number of packages pre-installed that are particularly useful for research and education. They provide the following user-interfaces by default:

```{panels}
:container: +interface-logos text-center
[Jupyter Lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/) / [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

```

For more information about each 2i2c Hub, see [](infrastructure.md).

## Who created the 2i2c Hubs?

2i2c Hubs are designed and deployed by the [International Interactive Computing Collaboration](https://2i2c.org) (or 2i2c). They are [a team with many years of experience](https://2i2c.org/about/) running interactive computing infrastructure for research and education.

## Who is eligible for the 2i2c Hubs pilot?

We are looking for small-ish users from research and education who would like to participate in this pilot program. If you'd like to do one or more of the following using interactive computing infrastructure in the cloud, please [get in touch](https://2i2c.org/#contact).

- Run a 3-50 person class
- Run data science infrastructure for your team or lab
- Run a collaborative project with distributed users
- Provide online interactive environments for content that you write
