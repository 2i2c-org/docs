# Default user interface

The 2i2c hubs offer the following user interfaces by default:

## Jupyter Notebook (Classic)

What many people mean when they say 'Jupyter', this familiar interface is used
by default. Document oriented, no-frills, and well known by a lot of people.

## JupyterLab

[JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab) is a more modern version of the classic Jupyter notebook from
the Jupyter project. It is more customizable and better supports advanced use cases - particularly around [dask](https://dask.org). Many
research organizations use this.

## RStudio
