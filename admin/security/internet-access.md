# Internet access from a hub

2i2c-managed hubs have a permissive network policy that allows unrestricted access to the internet.
Users should be able to access any resources on the internet from their interactive sessions.

## How can I restrict access to the internet on my hub?

If you would prefer your hub to have a more restrictive policy, please [get in touch with the Engineering team](mailto:support@2i2c.org) with your requirements.
