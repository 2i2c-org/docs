# Begin a new hub service

These instructions describe how to set up a new hub for your community.
Follow the sections below to do so.

## Confirm with a 2i2c team member

2i2c runs JupyterHubs as a service in exchange for a managed service fee.
Before getting a hub for your community, speak with a 2i2c representative to agree on the details of your service as well as the managed service fee.

You can [learn more about the 2i2c Managed JupyterHub Service here](../../about/service/index.md).

If you're interested in getting a hub for your community, click the button below.

## Identify a Community Representative

The Community Representative is the main point of contact between the community and the 2i2c Engineering Team.
There can be up to two Community Representatives per hub.
See [](../../about/service/shared-responsibility.md) for more details on this role.

## Fill in the "New Hub" GitHub template

We use a GitHub issue template to ask a few questions about your hub deployment that will help us deploy it.
Click the button below to go to the form:

```{button-link} https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%3A+hub&template=2_new-hub.yml&title=New+Hub%3A+%3CHub+name%3E
:color: primary
Go to new Hub Form
```

Feel free to communicate with the team members in that issue to help clarify how the infrastructure should be set up.

## Get support

Once the hub is up and running, you should use the 2i2c support channels to get support in modifying your hub.
See [](../../support.md) for instructions on how to do this.
