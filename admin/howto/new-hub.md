# Begin a new hub service

These instructions describe how to set up a new hub for your community.
Follow the sections below to do so.

## Confirm with a 2i2c team member

2i2c runs JupyterHubs as a service in exchange for a managed service fee.
Before getting a hub for your community, speak with a 2i2c representative to agree on the details of your service as well as the managed service fee.

You can [learn more about the 2i2c Managed JupyterHub Service here](../../about/service/index.md).
