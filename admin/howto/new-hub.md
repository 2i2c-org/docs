# Set up a new JupyterHub

In order to set up a new JupyterHub with 2i2c, there are a few steps that you should take.

## Identify a Community Representative

The Community Representative is the main point of contact between the community and the 2i2c Engineering Team.
There can be up to two Community Representatives per hub.
See [the pilot hubs documentation](tc:roles:community-representative) for more details on this role.

## Fill in the "New Hub" GitHub template

We use a GitHub issue template to ask a few questions about your hub deployment that will help us deploy it.
Click the button below to go to the form:

```{button-link} https://github.com/2i2c-org/pilot-hubs/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%3A+hub&template=new-hub.yml&title=New+Hub%3A+%3CHub+name%3E
:color: primary
Go to new Hub Form
```

Feel free to communicate with the team members in that issue to help clarify how the infrastructure should be set up.

## Get support

Once the hub is up and running, you should use the 2i2c support channels to get support in modifying your hub.
See [](support.md) for instructions on how to do this.
