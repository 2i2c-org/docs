# Get support

For most issues, the Community Champion of a hub should be able to solve the problem on their own.
Community Champions have **administrator rights** on a JupyterHub, and this comes with a number of tools and privileges that allow them to debug and assist others.

If a problem persists after attempting to solve it, or if the hub requires a change that the Community Champion cannot implement themselves, they should reach out to the 2i2c support team.
Hub engineers can provide support and debugging for issues that are related to the 2i2c Hub infrastructure.
There are a few ways to get in touch listed below (in decreasing order of preference!)

## File a support ticket

We handle most support requests via [GitHub issues in the `support/` repository](https://github.com/2i2c-org/support/issues).
This is a **private repository** that is accessible to Community Champions and 2i2c Engineers.
