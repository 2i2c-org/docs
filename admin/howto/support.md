# Get support

Hub engineers can provide support and debugging for issues that are related to the 2i2c Hub infrastructure. There are a few ways to get in touch listed below (in decreasing order of preference!)

## Via GitHub Issues

We handle most support requests via [GitHub issues in the `pilot/` repository](https://github.com/2i2c-org/pilot/issues).
This ensures that most support (and the resulting fixes) are done in a public place.

To help you open the right issue, here are a few buttons you can click to quickly open a support request in the `pilot/` repository:

## Connect on Slack

You're also welcome to connect with the 2i2c Hub Engineering team via [the 2i2c Slack](https://2i2c.slack.com) (in particular, check out the `#support` channel). If you don't have access to the Slack already, [open an issue in the pilot repository](https://github.com/2i2c-org/pilot/issues/new) and we're happy to give you access.

## Send a support email

For support requests that should not be public, you can also [send the 2i2c engineering team an email via `support@2i2c.org`](mailto:support@2i2c.org).
We prefer to handle support requests via public issue tracking, but understand that this is not always possible!
