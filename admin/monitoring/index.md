# Usage and cost monitoring

2i2c provides monitoring for all hubs to track usage patterns, detect abnormal behavior, and manage cloud costs. We deploy [Grafana Dashboards](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/) and [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) to provide visual dashboards for hub activity.

This section describes how to access and use these monitoring tools for your hub. Note that not all features are available for all hubs – please [contact us](/support) if you would like to discuss enabling a feature for your community with us.
