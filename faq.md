# Frequently Asked Questions

## Will my files and work persist between sessions?

Yes! Each user of a 2i2c Hub has their own filesystem that will persist between sessions.

## What happens if I want to move off of a 2i2c hub?

2i2c Hubs are designed to use entirely open source tools that are vendor- and workflow-agnostic. Our goal is to provide you with interactive computing environments that seamlessly integrate with pre-existing workflows across the research and education community. That means that it should be **extremely easy** to move off of a 2i2c Hub and into a different online environment that uses the Jupyter stack (or simply onto your own computer). For example, you can [download all of your files](download-as-pdf).
