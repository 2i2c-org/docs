# Choose the interface

There are a three main interfaces available on the 2i2c Hubs. You may choose from each of these by altering the URL of your session. For example, here is the general structure of a URL for your personal 2i2c Hub session:

```
https://<your-hub>.pilot.2i2c.cloud/user/<your-username>/<your-interface>
```

You can replace the contents of `<your-interface>` to be one of the following:

- **JupyterLab**: `/lab`
- **Jupyter Notebook**: `/tree`
- **RStudio**: `/rstudio`

Note that your 2i2c Hub administrator can also configure the **default** interface that users see. In addition, you can configure the interface that **nbgitpuller links** point to, see [](include-content) for information about nbgitpuller links.
