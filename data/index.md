# Data and Filesystem

This section describes how files and data storage are handled in 2i2c Hubs.

## Quick recommendations

Some quick recommendations for how to handle data:

- Use your home directory to store code, notebooks, and small data files (<1 GB)
  for personal use
- Use cloud object storage to store larger datasets and to share data across your team
- Consider whether your project would benefit from other cloud-native data storage
  solutions such as a database, data warehouse, or data lake
