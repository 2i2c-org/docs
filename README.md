# 2i2c Managed Hub Service Documentation

This repository serves as the user-facing documentation and communication space for those who are using 2i2c Hubs.

Most of the infrastructure that we discuss in the documentation is deployed [in the `infrastructure/` repository](https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure).

See [the service documentation](https://docs.2i2c.org) for more information.
